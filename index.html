                        <p>
                            The Seventh-day Adventist Church, established in the mid-19th century, is a Protestant Christian denomination that worships on Saturdays, recognizing it as the Sabbath. The Seventh-Day Adventist church is known for their unique focus on health and well-being, often referred to as the "health message." This encourages a balanced lifestyle, including a vegetarian or plant-based diet, regular exercise, and avoiding harmful substances like alcohol and tobacco. The idea is that taking care of your body is a way to honor God, as they believe the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. The church also places a strong emphasis on the soon return of Jesus Christ.</p>
